The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network. DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), adding the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network addresses and additional configuration options.  DHCP captures the behavior of BOOTP relay agents, and DHCP participants can interoperate with BOOTP participants.
This program is a high performance multithreaded DHCP server written entirely in Erlang. It strives to be fully functional, and RFC compliant.
The main advantages of erlang-dhcp-server compared to other DHCP servers are performance and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes from Erlang as well. Network servers don't have to be written in ugly adhoc languages.
